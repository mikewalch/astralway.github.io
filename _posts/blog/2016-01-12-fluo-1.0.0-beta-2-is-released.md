The Fluo project is happy to announce a [1.0.0-beta-2] release which is the
third release of Fluo and likely the final release before 1.0.0.  Many
improvements in this release were driven by the creation of two new Fluo related
projects:

* [Fluo recipes][fluo-recipes] is a collection of common development patterns
designed to make Fluo application development easier.  Creating Fluo recipes
required new Fluo functionality and updates to the Fluo API.  The first release
of Fluo recipes has been made and is available in [Maven Central][central].

* [WebIndex][webindex] is an example Fluo application that indexes links to web
pages in multiple ways.  Webindex enabled the testing of Fluo on real data at
scale.  It also inspired improvements to Fluo to allow it to work better with
Apache Spark.

Fluo is now at a point where its two cluster test suites, [Webindex][webindex]
and [Stress][fluo-stress], are running well for long periods on Amazon EC2.  We
invite early adopters to try out the beta-2 release and help flush out problems
before 1.0.0.
