The Fluo project is happy to announce the [1.0.0-beta-1] release of [Fluo].  This is the second 
release of Fluo.

We invite developers read the Fluo [documentation], play with the [quickstart] & [phrasecount] 
examples, and contribute back in the form of bug reports, new feature requests, and pull requests.

Fluo is an implementation of Google's [percolator paper][paper], which adds large-scale incremental 
processing of data using distributed transactions and notifications. It runs on [YARN] and stores its 
data in [Accumulo]. 

[Release notes][notes] and [javadocs] are available.  The Fluo [jars] have been deployed to 
Maven Central.
