The [1.0.0-alpha-1][release] release is the first release of Fluo.  It is not ready for production use.  See the [release notes][notes] for 
significant features. [Javadocs][apidocs] are also available.

## Quickstart

If you are new to Fluo, the best way to get started is to follow the [quickstart] which starts a local Fluo instance 
(called MiniFluo).  By using MiniFluo, you can avoid following the steps below to run your own Fluo instance.

## Running a Fluo instance

In order to run a Fluo instance, you will need [Accumulo] (version 1.6+), [Hadoop] (version 2.2+), and [Zookeeper] installed and
running on your local machine or cluster.

Fluo distributions are built for specific releases of Hadoop and Accumulo.  If you are using Accumulo 1.6.1 and Hadoop 2.3.0, you
can download the [1.0.0-alpha-1 tarball][release]. Otherwise, you will need to clone the Fluo repo and build a distribution tarball
of 1.0.0-alpha-1 for your environment:

{% highlight bash %}
git clone https://github.com/fluo-io/fluo.git
cd fluo/
git checkout 1.0.0-alpha-1
mvn package -Daccumulo.version=1.6.1-SNAPSHOT -Dhadoop.version=2.4.0
{% endhighlight %}

The distribution tarball will be created in ```modules/distribution/target```

When you have a Fluo distribution, install it to a directory:

{% highlight bash %}
tar xzf fluo-distribution-1.0.0-alpha-1-bin.tar.gz
{% endhighlight %}

Next, follow the instructions to configure and run Fluo in the [README].

## Running Fluo applications

Once you have Fluo installed and running on your cluster, you can now run Fluo applications.  Fluo applications consist of 
clients and observers. If you are new to Fluo, consider first building and running the [phrasecount] application on your Fluo
instance.  Otherwise, you will need to include the following in your Maven pom and follow the steps below to create your own
Fluo client or observer:

{% highlight xml %}
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.fluo</groupId>
  <artifactId>fluo-api</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0-alpha-1</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.fluo</groupId>
  <artifactId>fluo-core</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0-alpha-1</version>
  <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
{% endhighlight %}

### Creating a Fluo client

To create a [FluoClient], you will need all properties with the ```io.fluo.client.*``` prefix set in the configuration that is passed
to the ```newClient()``` method of [FluoFactory].  See [fluo.properties] for details on these properties.

### Creating a Fluo observer

To create an observer, follow these steps:

1. Create a class that extends [AbstractObserver].
2. Build a jar containing this class and include this jar in ```lib/observers``` of your Fluo installation.
3. Configure your Fluo instance to use this observer by modifying the Observer section of [fluo.properties].  
4. Restart your Fluo instance so that your Fluo workers load the new observer.
