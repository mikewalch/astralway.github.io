Fluo 1.0.0-beta-2 is the third official release of Fluo.  The release closed [48 tickets][tickets].

## Significant features

This release contains many new features that makes it easier to run, develop, and monitor Fluo applications.

#### Improved Fluo metrics that can be sent to InfluxDB and viewed in Grafana

In [#569][569], [#570][570], & [#580][580], Fluo metrics and monitoring were refactored to fix several
bugs and allow metrics to be sent to InfluxDB and viewed in Grafana.  Fluo metrics are still instrumented
using [Dropwizard metrics][dropwizard] but in [#574][574] metrics configuration was moved from its own
file and to now reside in `fluo.properties`.  While Fluo metrics can still be sent to many different
tools (i.e Graphite, Ganglia), Fluo now ships with configuration that can be used to configure a Fluo
dashboard in Grafana that queries InfluxDB.  To set up the sending of Fluo metrics to InfluxDB/Grafana,
view this [documentation][grafan-docs] or consider using [Fluo-dev][fluo-dev] or [Fluo-deploy][fluo-deploy]
to run Fluo as they can install InfluxDB+Grafana and setup metrics for you.

#### Improved Fluo administration

Several commands were added to the `fluo` script which is used to administer Fluo.  A `fluo exec` command
([#581][581]) was created to provide an easy way to execute application code using Fluo classes and dependencies.
A `fluo list` command ([#523][523]) was created to let users list all Fluo applications within a Fluo instance.
The `fluo scan` command now has a `--raw` option ([#597][597]) that prints Fluo data as stored in Accumulo. This
was accomplished by moving the Fluo formatter from Accumulo shell to the scan command.  The scan can now format non-ascii characters as hex ([#568][568]).  The `fluo new` command
was improved to prevent users from setting invalid Fluo application names ([#510][510]).  A bug was fixed in the
`fluo start` command that was causing time outs when starting applications ([#562][562]).  Finally, the `fluo`
command can now be run without the `apps/` directory configured for an application for most commands ([#524][524]).
Only the `init` and `start` commands need this directory configured.  All other commands only require the default
properties file to be configured at `conf/fluo.properties`.

#### Made Fluo work well with Spark

Several changes were made to Fluo to allow it work better with Apache Spark.  All Fluo data types now implement `Serializable`
and can be use in Spark RDDs ([#539][539]).  Fluo data types also now implement `Comparable` which allows RDDs of Fluo data types
to be sorted ([#544][544]).  Also, a no args constructor was created for the MutableBytes data type to enable Kryo serialization
in Spark ([#549][549]).  Finally, a new InputFormat called `FluoEntryInputFormat` was created that returns key/value entries and
the existing `FluoInputFormat` that returns rows was renamed `FluoRowInputFormat` ([#538][538],[#540][540]).

#### Performance improvements

A good bit of time was spent analyzing Fluo while it was running to determine
where time is spent when executing transactions.   Based on this analysis it
was found that a good bit of time was spent committing transactions.  Changes
were made in Fluo and Accumulo in order to decrease commit time.  For Fluo the
following changes were made :

* [#591][591] - Shared batch writer increases transaction history
* [#590][590] - Increased batch writer threads and made configurable
* [#589][589] - Added 2nd conditional writer and logging of commit times
* [#584][584] - Adjust number of conditional writer threads based on cluster size

For Accumulo changes are being made in [ACCUMULO-4066] to decrease the time it
takes to process conditional mutations.  Conditional mutations are used when
Fluo commits a transaction.

These changes resulted in nice improvements over beta-1 in testing.  However there
is probably still room for improvement.  More analysis is needed.

#### Other important improvements and bug fixes

* [#598][598] - Upgraded Hadoop to 2.6.3 and Accumulo to 1.6.4
* [#587][587] - Specified datasource for all graphs in fluo's Grafana dashboard
* [#586][586] - Added efficient and easy way to build Bytes objects
* [#578][578] - Plot nothing in Grafana when no data exists
* [#573][573] - Fixed issues building again Accumulo 1.8.0-SNAPSHOT
* [#566][566] - Added RowColumnValue and made Accumulo init code use it
* [#561][561] - Stopped checkstyle mvn plugin from running at validate
* [#559][559] - Eventually drop deleted data
* [#558][558] - Added arguments to deploy command to skip findbugs, checkstyle, and auto-formatting
* [#556][556] - Make TravisCI deploy snapshot jars after successful builds
* [#552][552] - Made eclipse stop complaining about unknown plugins
* [#551][551] - Added method to get start timestamp of transaction
* [#550][550] - Changed setObservers() to addObservers()
* [#547][547] - Provide better documentation for LoaderExecutor
* [#535][535] - Upgraded Twill to 0.6.0-incubating
* [#520][520] - Consolidate all implementation properties into FluoConfigurationImpl
* [#518][518] - Make Oracle run on a random port

* [#495][495] - Add support for notifications to Fluo formatter

## Testing

For this release, a long run of the [Webindex][webindex] application was performed and is documented in
[a blog post][webindex-post].  A long run of [Fluo stress][fluo-stress] was run and documented in 
[another blog post][stress-post].
