Fluo tarball distributions are available on GitHub for download using the links below:

* [Latest Release][latest]
* [All Releases][all]

Before downloading a distribution, consider running Fluo using [fluo-dev] (which sets up Fluo for development) 
or [Zetten] (which sets up Fluo on a cluster).  Both will download and install Fluo for you.

If you would rather install and run Fluo on your own, follow these [installation instructions][install].
